Jenny Quan 15-112 Term Project: Readme File

Introduction |

This Bee Game is a scaffolded final project created for the 15-112 cs course at Carnegie Mellon University. 

In this game, the player plays as a bee, which is controlled by moving the mouse pointer around the screen. The bee pollinates flowers (circles) by taking pollen from a male flower (solid circle) and passing it on to a female flower (ringed circle) of the matching color. The bee can hold pollen from up to six flowers at a time, and the pollen that it's currently holding is shown on the top-left corner of the screen. The game includes a tutorial stage that outlines this process, which upon finishing, continues on to an infinite version of the game, which also includes two helper bees that pollinate flowers alongside the player. The window that the game is played in is scalable.
